  While such a division in most languages would return a floating point number, in Clojure you get a specialized Rational type.
  (You can still do floating point division by making one of the operands floating point, as in <code class="expr">(/ 10 3.0)</code>).

  That's typical Clojure: once you're over the initial strangeness, this language will really bend backwards to save you time and trouble.
  As another example of this flexibility, many Clojure operations can take an arbitrary number of arguments.
  Try <code class="expr">(+ 1 2 3 4 5 6)</code>, or any other arithmetic operation.
</p>

<p>
  When you're ready, type <code class="expr">(/ 100 4 5)</code> to continue.
