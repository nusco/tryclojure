  That was a strange way to say "three plus two", wasn't it?
  As obscure as it looks at first, I can guarantee that this syntax will grow on you.
  Also, there is a very good reason for it: a Clojure program is made of <em>lists</em>.
  <code class="expr">(+ 3 2)</code> is a list that contains a function (plus), and then the function's operands.

  Later on, we'll see that this idea of having a program made of building programs out of lists gives us a few awesome features.
  For now, try out if you can do multiplication and subtractions (<code class="expr">*</code> and <code class="expr">-</code>).

  Division might surprise you. When you're ready to move forward, try <code class="expr">(/ 10 3)</code>.
